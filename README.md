# TLUC_HDEV.github.io
Housing and development aimed at reducing rents to as close to limit function (zero) as possible. TLUC (The Large and Unwieldy Company ) embarks to develop structures which are symbiotic and not inorganic masses of matter upon the Earth. With this in mind I hope that by using GitHub others can participate in development of APIs (specifically).
